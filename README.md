#Emoji Calculator 

A simple website that calculates the sum of two emojis by their "emotional value". 

Emotional values range from -1000 (🤬) to 1000 (🤣).

Example: 😀 + 😟 = 😐

Right now it's just faces since I honestly have no clue what happens when you add 🦋 and 🍼 (ideas and suggestions are welcome 👐)

### Tech stuff:
